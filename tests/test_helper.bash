# Extract a single function definition from a script and eval it into the
# current shell, so it can be tested in isolation without sourcing the whole
# script (which would trigger the orchestration `set -euo pipefail` main loop).
#
# Brace-depth tracking skips content inside single-quoted strings (in_sq toggle),
# which handles the embedded awk programs in these scripts — their { } characters
# are at the top level of the single-quoted awk body, not inside bash single-quotes.
# Constraint: do NOT use this helper on functions containing { } inside bash
# double-quoted strings or heredocs, as those would miscount depth.
#
# Usage: load_function <script_path> <function_name>
