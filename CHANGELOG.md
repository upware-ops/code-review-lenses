# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-14

### ⚠ Breaking

- **No longer a Claude Code plugin.** Removed `.claude-plugin/`, `CLAUDE.md`, plugin-namespace agent spawns, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` path lookup, and claude-mem. The package is an [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) checkout (`SKILL.md` + `agents/`) that any compatible host can load.
- **Renamed to `code-review-lenses`.** Skill directory is `skills/code-review-lenses/`; frontmatter `name:` and invocations are `/code-review-lenses`. The 1.x product name `comprehensive-review` is historical only.
- **Models are not hardcoded.** Agent frontmatter no longer sets `model:` / `color:`. Optional `skills/code-review-lenses/models.conf` defaults every role to `inherit`.
- **No PR/MR posting or creation.** Removed `--post-findings`, `--post-summary`, `--create-pr`, `--publish`, `--draft`, `--read-back`, `--no-post`, `--local`, `--no-findings`. Phase 4/4b are gone.
- **`--pr` and `--provider` removed.** External review is a PR/MR URL in the invoke text. Host and number come from `parse-pr-url.sh`. A bare number is not a PR/MR identity. Omitted `--base` on a PR/MR is the fetched target branch — never `main`/`master`/`dev`.
- **Mode flags replaced by `--profile`.** Removed `--quick`, `--security-only`, and `--depth`. Use `--profile quick|security|full|deep`. `--summary-only` remains (mutually exclusive with `--profile`).
- **Toolkit agents are vendored** (Apache-2.0). `pr-review-toolkit` is no longer an external plugin dependency.
- **Config paths** moved off `.claude/`. See Migration below.
- **`--no-mem`** was removed (claude-mem / novelty pass are gone). The parser rejects it.

### Migration (1.13.x → 2.0.0)

| 1.13 path / flag | 2.0 |
|------------------|-----|
| `.claude/comprehensive-review/suppressions.json` | `.code-review-lenses/suppressions.json` |
| `~/.claude/claude-security-guidance.md` | `~/.config/code-review-lenses/security-guidance.md` |
| `<repo>/.claude/claude-security-guidance.md` | `<repo>/.code-review-lenses/security-guidance.md` |
| `<repo>/.claude/claude-security-guidance.local.md` | `<repo>/.code-review-lenses/security-guidance.local.md` |
| `/comprehensive-review` | `/code-review-lenses` |
| `--quick` / `--security-only` / `--depth deep` | `--profile quick` / `--profile security` / `--profile deep` |
| `--pr <N>` / `--provider <name>` | PR/MR URL in the invoke text |
| `--post-findings`, `--create-pr`, `--no-post`, `--no-mem` | removed — local report only |

Copy the old files to the new paths if you still want those rules. 2.0 does **not** auto-load `.claude/` paths. **Rollback:** stay on (or pin) tag `v1.13.0` if you need plugin install, PR posting, or the old flags.

### Added

- Shipped parsers: `resolve-profile.sh`, `apply-roster-overlays.sh`, `detect-provider.sh`, `resolve-models.sh`, `resolve-skill-root.sh`, `parse-pr-url.sh`.
- GitLab via `glab` on any authenticated host (`GITLAB_HOST`, `glab config get host`, `glab auth status`), including nested groups.
- Bats coverage that drives those scripts (profiles, overlays, GitLab host detection, model inherit).
- Optional Claude and Grok workflow wrappers (`.claude/workflows/code-review-lenses-workflow.js`, `.grok/workflows/code-review-lenses-workflow.rhai`) that run the same local review. Roster and flags still come from the shipped parsers. Invoke text is passed through as `$ARGUMENTS`; leftover prose is `GUIDANCE`.
- `argument-hint` on the skill (and the same text on the workflow wrappers). Non-flag tokens are `GUIDANCE`. A PR/MR URL starts external review; remaining prose is review focus.
- `parse-pr-url.sh`: first GitHub / GitLab (any host, nested groups) / Bitbucket URL wins. Number-only text is not a PR identity. `PR_URL` is sanitized (no userinfo).
- `review-diff.sh`: local review uses `<base>...HEAD` when there are unique commits; otherwise a dirty working tree vs `$BASE`. Empty range is an explicit stop. PR/MR-URL worktrees stay on `<base>...HEAD`.
- Invoke text is written to a file and parsed with `resolve-profile.sh --from-file` (no unquoted `$ARGUMENTS` on a bash command line). Wrappers fence `<invoke-argv>` and run Phase 2 before Phase 3.
- GitHub provider OPs pin `GH_HOST` and `--repo`. CVE findings emit `source` + `confidence`. `run-trufflehog.sh` no longer expands an empty array under `set -u`.
- `review-diff.sh` verifies `--base` (`rev-parse`) and refuses option-shaped refs. Dirty `DIFF_FILE` includes untracked via `git diff --no-index`.
- `GUIDANCE` / `GUIDANCE_REST` strip URL userinfo. `detect-provider.sh --check-url-host` gates `gh`/`glab` after a PR/MR URL. `GATE_CODE_OR_INFRA` cheapens architecture only on `--profile full`.
- OSV malformed / index-mismatch and unparseable trufflehog NDJSON exit 1 (`CVE_CHECK_FAILED` / `ANALYZER_FAILED`). Wrappers run Phase 0b (worktree, `baseRefName`, `--check-url-host`, `resolve-models.sh`).
- `--check-url-host` is URL-review only (never local `unknown`); GitHub no longer treats origin-match as enough. `GUIDANCE_REST` is noglob. Analyzer parse/crash and CVE merge/per-package parse fail exit 1. Security-gate grep rc 2 aborts.
- Nightly `vendor-sync` workflow: refreshes the five vendored `pr-review-toolkit` agents into a PR on this repo (local patches re-applied); posts a digest issue for `tag1consulting/claude-comprehensive-review` (never auto-merged).

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-16

### ⚠ Behavior change

- **`--post-findings` now stages an editable draft by default instead of publishing immediately.** On GitHub this creates a PENDING review (`POST .../pulls/{n}/reviews` with no `event`); on GitLab it creates draft notes (`POST .../draft_notes`). Either way, the draft is visible only to the invoking user and nothing is published until they edit and submit it themselves in the provider's web UI. **Add `--publish` to restore the previous (pre-1.13.0) immediate-publish behavior** — this is required for any CI/scripted invocation, since a bot has no web UI to submit a draft from. Bitbucket is unaffected: it has no verified draft-create path in the public REST API, so `--post-findings` there always publishes a single PR comment, with a one-line notice.

### Added

- **"Human in the Middle" draft review mode** (`--draft`, `--publish`): implements the staging-layer workflow described in the "Human in the Middle" pattern — the AI drafts, the human edits and submits, never the other way around. `--draft` is an explicit no-op alias of the new default, for scripts that want to pin the behavior. New `PROVIDERS.md` operation "OP: Stage draft review" is kept separate from the existing publish operation so the "never call a submit/publish endpoint" invariant is greppable and covered by structural tests.
- **`--read-back`** (GitHub/GitLab only): reads back the user's currently-staged draft (pending review comments / draft notes), reports which of this run's findings the human kept, edited, or removed. On GitLab, newly-noticed findings are staged as additional draft notes. **On GitHub, they are reported in the terminal only** — the REST pending-review API only accepts comments at creation time and cannot append to an existing pending review (appending would require the GraphQL `addPullRequestReviewThread` mutation, not implemented in this version), so the human adds any agreed-on findings themselves in the web UI. Never publishes and never overwrites the human's edits. Requires an existing draft from a prior `--post-findings` run. **Cost note:** since the comparison is against "this run's findings," `--read-back` re-runs the full Phase 0–3 analysis pipeline to regenerate them — it costs the same as a full review, not a lightweight diff.
- **GitHub one-pending-review-per-PR pre-check**: before staging, the orchestrator checks for an existing self-authored PENDING review and refuses cleanly (rather than surfacing a raw 422) if one exists, directing the user to edit/submit or delete it in the web UI first.
- New Orchestrator Governance rule: "Draft mode never publishes" — explicitly forbids calling any submit/publish endpoint (GitHub review-events, GitLab `bulk_publish`) while staging.
- New structural tests in `tests/orchestration_contracts.bats` assert the draft OP never contains a live invocation of a publish/submit endpoint, and that `--draft`/`--publish`/`--read-back` are documented consistently across `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `HELP.md`.

### Fixed

- **GitHub read-back's PENDING-review filter no longer uses an unresolved placeholder or invalid syntax.** Two bugs were found and fixed during live E2E and multi-agent review of this feature before release: an early version compared `.user.login` against a literal, never-resolved `"<self>"` string; a later fix for that introduced an invalid `gh api --jq --arg` invocation (`gh api`'s `--jq` flag takes exactly one query string and does not support jq's own `--arg`). Both made GitHub `--read-back` non-functional as written. Fixed by resolving the invoking user's login via `gh api user --jq .login` and piping the pending-review query to a standalone `jq --arg` call.
- **The GitHub pending-review pre-check no longer silently reports "0 pending reviews" when the login lookup fails.** A prior version fell back to an empty-string login on lookup failure and queried with it — an empty string can never match a real GitHub login, so the pre-check always returned a false "all clear" instead of genuinely skipping the check. It now skips the query entirely on lookup failure and warns explicitly.
- **GitLab read-back's net-new-finding staging no longer risks a stale-SHA race.** The diff-version SHAs used to position a new draft note were previously captured once at Phase 4b entry, before the full analysis pipeline reruns and the user confirms staging — an arbitrarily long window during which a new commit on the MR could make those SHAs stale. The SHAs are now re-fetched immediately before the staging call, and a failed re-fetch is reported as a distinct error rather than being misreported through the generic inline-post-failure path.
- **Four missing `--read-back` flag-conflict checks added**, closing gaps found across two independent review passes: `--read-back` combined with `--publish`/`--draft` previously produced a contradictory error-message loop (each error told the user to do the thing the other error forbade); `--read-back` combined with `--create-pr` on a branch with no existing PR/MR silently created a new PR and then ran the read-back against it, which by construction could have no prior draft.
- Corrected an overstated claim that GitHub's REST docs guarantee PENDING reviews are visible only to their author — the docs confirm the not-yet-submitted state but do not document an explicit access-control guarantee for who can see it beforehand. The docs and code comments now describe "unpublished" as the verified property and "author-only visible" as a reasonable but unverified assumption.
- Added a documented rollback path ("if draft mode misbehaves") for the (unlikely, but possible) case that a future GitHub or GitLab API change breaks the draft-staging invariant, plus a runtime notice appended to every successful draft-staging report reminding the user to confirm the review shows as Pending/draft in the web UI before sharing the PR link.
- Added a runtime migration notice printed when `--post-findings` is used without `--publish` or an explicit `--draft`, so a script or CI job that relied on the pre-1.13.0 immediate-publish default gets a live signal that behavior changed, not just a silent change in outcome.
- Fixed a pre-existing, unrelated bug in `run-phpcs.sh`: `$PHPCS_STANDARD` was only initialized on the live-`phpcs` code path, leaving it unbound (and the resulting `jq` call silently discarding findings) whenever the mock/offline path was used — including every run of the bats test suite. Now initialized unconditionally.

### Known limitations

- Bitbucket draft-review support is out of scope this release: the Cloud REST v2 comment schema has a `pending` field, but creating a pending comment via the public API is not confirmed in Atlassian's official documentation (the "Batched comments" feature is documented as UI-driven). Revisit with a live API spike.
- GitLab's draft-note staging and `--read-back` net-new-finding staging paths were not exercised against a live GitLab instance for this release — only GitHub was live-E2E-tested. Both are covered by structural bats tests asserting API-call shape, not by a live run. Treat the GitLab path as less battle-tested than GitHub's until a live GitLab E2E is performed.

## [1.12.2] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **COMMENTS validation tightened; line 0 rejected** (#108): The inline review payload builder now rejects `LINE=0` values before constructing the `argjson` payload, preventing malformed GitHub API calls that would silently drop inline comments.
- **`LINE` validated before `argjson` construction** (#108): Added explicit numeric validation of the `LINE` variable before it is used in `--argjson` to prevent jq parse errors from propagating to the API call.
- **Prompt-injection guard centralized in `GOVERNANCE.md`** (#109): The canonical untrusted-input guard directive is now in `GOVERNANCE.md` (injected into every custom agent) rather than duplicated across individual agent prompts. Ensures new agents get the guard automatically.
- **jq-based JSON payload construction mandated in `PROVIDERS.md`** (#109): Documented requirement to use `jq --arg`/`--argjson` for all provider API payloads; string interpolation into JSON is prohibited.
- **SHA-pinned `ruby/setup-ruby` in `pages.yml`** (#110): The GitHub Pages CI action now pins `ruby/setup-ruby` to its full commit SHA rather than a floating tag, eliminating supply-chain risk on the docs build.

### Changed

- **AI review now runs on all PRs including renovate and dependabot** (#117): Removed the `github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'` and `github.actor != 'renovate[bot]'` skip conditions from the dogfood workflow's `review` job. Every non-draft PR now receives a review. The `skip-ai-review` label remains as a per-PR escape hatch.
- **`review-gate` wrapper job removed from dogfood workflow** (#117): Branch protection on `main` now requires the `review` job directly. The gate wrapper was only needed to pass branch protection when bots were skipped; it is no longer necessary.
- **`fail-on-findings` wired into dogfood workflow** (#116): The dogfood `ai-pr-review.yml` passes `fail-on-findings: ${{ vars.AI_REVIEW_FAIL_ON_FINDINGS || 'false' }}` to the container action, enabling the CI automerge gate via the `AI_REVIEW_FAIL_ON_FINDINGS` repo variable.

### Internal

- **`plugin.json` version bump to `1.12.1`** (v1.12.1 release): Corrected inflated cost figures in `SKILL.md` ($30-80 replaced with measured ~$0.25 quick / ~$0.50-$1.25 full) and fixed token utilization table description in `README.md`.

---

## [1.12.0] - 2026-06-04

### Removed

- **`--diagrams` flag and Mermaid sequence diagram output** (#93): The opt-in `--diagrams` flag and the `## Sequence Diagrams` section in Block A have been removed. The feature was default-off and never produced reliable enough output to keep. A stale `--diagrams` flag passed by existing users is silently ignored. Removed from `SKILL.md`, `HELP.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `agents/pr-summarizer.md`.
- **`ai-pr-review` git submodule** (#89): Removed the stale `.gitmodules` entry and `.github/actions/ai-pr-review` submodule path left over from the earlier migration to the container action. No workflow logic changes.

### Fixed

- **Token utilization table: replaced unfillable In/Out/Cache columns with blended `Tokens` total** (#95): The Agent tool exposes only a single `subagent_tokens` combined total per agent — it does not provide an input/output/cache breakdown. The previous 8-column table had four permanently unfillable columns, causing inconsistent LLM output between runs. Replaced with a 5-column table (`Agent`, `Model`, `Tokens`, `Tools`, `Est. Cost`) using blended per-model rates (Opus ~$45/M, Sonnet ~$9/M, Haiku ~$0.8/M) with a `/cost` footnote for exact figures.
- **`shell.md` language profile: correct `suppressions.json` path** (#94): The path reference now correctly reads `skills/comprehensive-review/suppressions.json` instead of the vague `suppressions.json` (the file is not at the repo root).

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **6 new static analyzers** (#86): Ported from `ai-pr-review` and wired into Phase 1b orchestration. All are opportunistic (silently skipped when the binary is absent) and use mock-file-based offline bats tests (no real binary invoked in CI).
  - **`run-eslint.sh`** — JavaScript/TypeScript linting via ESLint. Triggers on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` files; skips silently when no ESLint config is found in the repo root (`GITHUB_WORKSPACE`). Detects `--no-warn-ignored` support via `--help` (not `--version`, which short-circuits arg parsing). Severity mapping: `error` → High, `warning` → Medium.
  - **`run-hadolint.sh`** — Dockerfile linting. Triggers on `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.*`, and `*.dockerfile` variants. Severity mapping: `error` → High, `warning` → Medium, `info`/`style` → Low.
  - **`run-kube-linter.sh`** — Kubernetes manifest linting. Triggers on `.yaml`, `.yml`, and `.json` files that contain `apiVersion:` and `kind:` fields (content-sniff guard avoids running on non-K8s YAML). All findings mapped to Medium.
  - **`run-phpcs.sh`** — PHP CodeSniffer. Triggers on `.php` files. Uses `Drupal`/`DrupalPractice` standard when phpstan-drupal is available, falls back to `PSR12`. Remediation string uses the active standard (not hardcoded). Severity mapping: `error` → High, `warning` → Medium.
  - **`run-phpstan.sh`** — PHP static analysis. Triggers on `.php`, `.module`, `.inc`, `.install`, `.theme` files. Vendor paths (`phpstan-drupal`, `autoload.php`) resolved relative to `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` (repo root) rather than script CWD. All findings mapped to High.
  - **`run-tflint.sh`** — Terraform linting. Triggers on `.tf` and `.tfvars` files; runs per-directory, prepending the directory prefix to bare filenames in output. Captures exit code explicitly (`DIR_EC`) to distinguish violations-found (exit 1) from fatal config errors (exit >= 2). Severity mapping: `error` → High, `warning` → Medium, `notice` → Low.
- **96 new bats tests** (#86): Mock-file-driven test suites for all 6 new analyzers, covering no-op paths, schema conformance, severity mapping, stdin support, and tool-absent behavior. Total test suite grows from 54 to 150.

### Fixed

- **`checkov --compact` flag** (#87): Added `--compact` to the `checkov` invocation in `run-checkov.sh`. Without it, passing checks bloat the JSON output significantly, slowing processing and inflating context.
- **Trufflehog allowlist: single-quoted and unquoted YAML path entries no longer silently dropped** (#87): `_build_allowlist_json()` previously only extracted double-quoted path entries from `.trufflehog.yml`. Entries in YAML bare form (`- path/to/file`) or single-quoted form (`- 'path/to/file'`) were silently ignored, leaving findings at allowlisted paths unsuppressed. Awk state machine rewritten to handle all three forms. Block-termination patterns broadened from `/^[a-zA-Z]/` to `/^[^[:space:]]/` to correctly stop at top-level YAML keys starting with digits or underscores.

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **`security-guidance` plugin integration via shared org-policy file** (#82): `security-reviewer` now reads the same `claude-security-guidance.md` org-policy file used by the `security-guidance@claude-plugins-official` plugin, giving both tools a single shared policy source. Phase 0 step 10 loads up to three locations in priority order (`~/.claude/`, `<repo>/.claude/`, `<repo>/.claude/claude-security-guidance.local.md`), concatenates with an 8 KB ceiling, and injects as a `SECURITY_POLICY:` directive into the security-reviewer task description. Policy rules are applied only to introduced or modified code. `security-guidance` is documented as a recommended companion plugin. The project-scoped paths are loaded from the reviewer's own checkout only — never from the branch under review in `--pr` mode — to prevent prompt injection via attacker-committed policy files.
- **`examples/claude-security-guidance.example.md`**: Annotated multi-section copy-and-fill-in template for org security policy rules, organized by category (data access, auth/secrets, injection/SSRF, dependencies, logging). The `.example.md` suffix is intentional — the loader matches the exact filename `claude-security-guidance.md`/`.local.md`, so the template is never auto-loaded.

### Fixed

- **`REPO_ROOT` undefined in policy loader**: The initial implementation referenced `${REPO_ROOT}` which was never assigned, causing the two repo-scoped policy file paths to silently expand to `/.claude/...` (filesystem root) and never load. Fixed by resolving `_sg_repo_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)` before the loop and using conditional expansion (`${VAR:+"$VAR/..."}`) to skip candidates when the variable is empty.
- **`HOME` unset in policy loader**: A hardened CI container or non-login Docker user with `HOME` unset would cause the user-wide candidate to expand to `/.claire/...`. Fixed by using `${HOME:+"$HOME/..."}` conditional expansion.
- **Truncation comment accuracy**: Updated comment to accurately describe that truncation is a hard character-offset cut that may split a mid-file rule (not a clean whole-rule drop), and added a `[SECURITY_POLICY truncated at 8KB limit]` marker so the agent and debugging users can see when content was cut.
- **Policy rules scoped to changed lines**: Added instruction to `security-reviewer.md` to apply policy rules only to introduced or modified code, not to pre-existing unchanged lines or occurrences in comments/string literals unless the rule explicitly targets them.

---

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-28

### Removed

- **`/comprehensive-review-help` skill** (#81): Removed — the verbatim-output skill approach produces blank output in Claude Code. Users can access the full flag reference via `HELP.md` directly or via the README.

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Structured `category` field in `json-findings` contract** (#76): All custom agents (architecture-reviewer, security-reviewer, blind-hunter, edge-case-hunter, adversarial-general) and the CVE dependency check now emit a required `category` field with a fixed taxonomy (`authz`, `injection`, `dependency-cve`, `secret`, `architecture-coupling`, `test-gap`, `edge-case`, `observability`, `docs`, `lint`, `other`). Phase 2 normalization validates and normalizes the field. `SEVERITY.md` documents the full contract. This enables structured filtering and deduplication.
- **Gate evaluation extracted to `evaluate-gates.sh`** (#72): The four agent-dispatch gate checks (`GATE_ERROR_PATTERNS`, `GATE_CONTROL_FLOW`, `GATE_SECURITY_PATTERNS`, `GATE_CODE_OR_INFRA`) are now a standalone script at `skills/comprehensive-review/scripts/evaluate-gates.sh`. Inputs: `DIFF_FILE` and `DIFF_PATHS` env vars. Output: sourceable `key=value` pairs. Conservative fallback: all gates default to `true` when inputs are missing. Makes gate logic independently testable.
- **Auto-cheap routing for docs-only and low-risk-config diffs** (#78): When all changed files are documentation/meta (`DOCS_ONLY=true`), Opus agents are automatically skipped without requiring `--quick`, reducing cost by ~60%. When the diff contains only config/YAML/TOML with no security-sensitive patterns (`LOW_RISK_CONFIG=true`), specialist agents are skipped. Both modes still run pr-summarizer, code-reviewer, and triggered conditionals. Phase 5 reports the auto-cheap reason. `HELP.md` documents both modes.
- **Novelty pass for repeated low-value findings** (#77): After deduplication (new Phase 2f), Low and Medium findings whose `category+file` fingerprint appeared in ≥2 prior reviews in `PRIOR_REVIEW_CONTEXT` are annotated with `[recurring — appeared in prior reviews]`. Findings are never deleted or severity-demoted. Critical/High findings and `dependency-check` CVE findings are excluded. Requires `--no-mem` to disable; skipped when `--quick`, `--security-only`, or `--summary-only` mode is active, or when fewer than 2 prior review entries exist.
- **`/comprehensive-review-help` skill** (#73): Replaced the dead-end placeholder with a functional skill that outputs the full `HELP.md` content verbatim.
- **PR/MR body included in `PR_NARRATIVE`** (#70): All three providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) now fetch the `body`/`description` field when collecting PR/MR metadata in `--pr <N>` mode. GitLab `description` and Bitbucket `description` are mapped to `body`. This reduces false positives by giving agents the author's intent statement.
- **`bats` test suite with 54 tests** (#74, #75): Added `tests/` directory with four test files:
  - `run_cve_check.bats` — 10 tests: `parse_go_mod` replace-directive ordering (covers #67 bug), no-op paths, and end-to-end OSV batch mock tests including CVSS v4 conservative fallback.
  - `run_trufflehog.bats` — 5 tests: verified/unverified secret demotions, empty mock, no changed files.
  - `evaluate_gates.bats` — 15 tests: all four gates with positive/negative cases and fallback behavior.
  - `orchestration_contracts.bats` — 24 golden tests: SKILL.md structural integrity, SEVERITY.md contract, PROVIDERS.md correctness, gate fixture decisions, and CVE category field.

### Fixed

- **Go `replace` directive ordering bug in CVE check** (#67): `parse_go_mod()` in `run-cve-check.sh` rewritten as two-pass awk using the `FNR == NR` idiom. The original single-pass code missed replace directives when `require` appeared before `replace` (the standard go.mod layout). Both orderings now resolve correctly; local-path replacements keep the original module.
- **`Write` tool missing from `allowed-tools` frontmatter** (#68): The `Write` tool is now listed in `SKILL.md`'s `allowed-tools` frontmatter, enabling `--output-file` functionality that was silently failing.
- **GitHub inline review incorrectly documented as using MCP tool** (#69): `SKILL.md` and `PROVIDERS.md` updated to reflect the actual `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews` invocation. `mcp__github-pat__create_pull_request_review` was never the implementation and is no longer referenced.
- **TruffleHog scanning wrong input** (#71): Phase 1b now pipes `$DIFF_PATHS` to `run-trufflehog.sh` instead of passing `$DIFF_FILE`. This lets TruffleHog scan live files at their real paths (for accurate detector matching and file:line attribution) rather than scanning a combined diff text blob.

### Changed

- **Secret redaction step renumbered** from 2f to 2g to accommodate the new novelty pass (2f).
- **Step 2e deduplication** now uses the structured `category` field for file-level deduplication, not the informal bracketed prose label.
- **PROVIDERS.md**: GitHub inline review section rewritten to show actual `gh api` invocation; `body` field documented for all three providers' metadata fetch commands.
- **SEVERITY.md**: New "json-findings field contract" section with the full field table and category taxonomy.

---

## [1.8.11] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- New `GOVERNANCE.md` directive: **Cite evidence in the finding.** Findings must reference the specific code that exhibits the problem (snippet, symbol, or pattern at `file:line`) — the json-findings location fields are not the citation. Intended to reduce hallucinated structural findings; effectiveness has not been measured.
- New `GOVERNANCE.md` directive: **Refuse incoherent input.** If a diff contradicts its own commit message or claims to fix something it doesn't touch, agents surface that as a top-level finding rather than reviewing line-by-line as if coherent.
- New Orchestrator Governance directive in `SKILL.md`: **Cite the observed result, not the action taken.** Phase 4/4b/5 success claims reference the provider-returned URL, ID, or status — not just the fact that an API call was attempted.
- Phase 4/4b/5 capture-variable wiring to back the new directive with mechanism rather than text. Phase 4 PR/MR creation captures provider stdout/exit into `CREATED_PR_URL`/`CREATED_PR_ERROR`; Phase 4 comment posting captures `POSTED_COMMENT_REF`/`POSTED_COMMENT_ERROR`; Phase 4b inline review posting captures `POSTED_REVIEW_URL`/`POSTED_REVIEW_ID`/`INLINE_POSTED_COUNT`/`INLINE_FAILED_COUNT`/`POSTED_REVIEW_ERROR`; Phase 5 worktree cleanup verifies removal via `[[ -e "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]]` and sets `WORKTREE_REMOVED`; Phase 5 claude-mem POST captures `MEM_HTTP_STATUS` via `curl -w '%{http_code}'` and only reports success on 2xx. Phase 5 terminal output cites these captured values rather than asserting success from the fact that an API call was invoked. Failure paths are reported plainly when capture variables are empty.
- BLIND_HUNTER_NOTE extended to scope the new "Refuse incoherent input" directive to incoherence visible within the diff itself (e.g., a hunk that calls a symbol the same diff just deleted), preserving blind-hunter's zero-context constraint.

### Fixed

Robustness fixes to the Phase 4/4b/5 capture-variable patterns, addressing AI review findings on PR #79:

- **`gh pr create` URL extraction:** initial fix replaced combined-stream `grep` with a two-step `gh pr create` (for exit code) → `gh pr view --json url --jq '.url'` pattern. Round-2 review correctly noted that `gh pr view` without an explicit branch argument can return the wrong PR if HEAD is detached. Final form: capture stdout into `CREATE_OUT` and stderr into a temp file separately (`gh pr create ... 2>"$CREATE_ERR_FILE"`), then extract the URL from stdout with a PR-path-specific regex `https://[^[:space:]]+/pull/[0-9]+`. `gh pr create` writes exactly the new PR URL to stdout on success, so this is unambiguous. Same separated-stream pattern applied to `glab mr create`, extracting against `merge_requests/[0-9]+`.
- **`POSTED_COMMENT_REF` empty-on-success false-failure:** exit code is now the primary success signal for `gh pr comment` / `glab mr comment`. An empty URL on RC=0 is reported as `(posted; URL not reported by gh)` rather than treated as failure — preventing a false failure report and a duplicate comment on retry.
- **`INLINE_POSTED_COUNT` parsed via follow-up GET, not from POST response:** GitHub silently drops inline comments whose target line is outside the diff (despite the Phase 4b step 1 valid-line filter — GitHub's own validation is stricter for renamed files, large hunks, etc.). The POST `/pulls/{N}/reviews` response does not include a `.comments` array — only the GET `/pulls/{N}/reviews/{review_id}/comments` endpoint does. After a successful POST, a follow-up GET retrieves the actual posted-comment count. A delta vs the request length triggers a "GitHub accepted the review but dropped <N> inline comment(s)" warning. (An earlier attempt parsed `(.comments // []) | length` of the POST response — which always evaluated to 0 because that field doesn't exist on POST. Fixed in the same PR before merge.)
- **GitLab inline-warning placeholder:** the warning log now uses `printf` with `${THREAD_RESPONSE:-no thread ID returned}` instead of a literal `<error or ...>` placeholder, so warnings carry the actual response content.
- **`git worktree remove` stderr capture:** previously used `2>/dev/null || true` and then synthesized `WORKTREE_CLEANUP_ERROR="path still exists at ..."` which never carried the actual git error. Now captures stderr into `WORKTREE_REMOVE_ERR` before the path-existence check; `WORKTREE_CLEANUP_ERROR` falls back to the captured stderr.
- **`MEM_RESPONSE_FILE` mktemp guard + response body preserved:** `mktemp` now falls back to `/dev/null` on failure (preventing curl from writing to an empty-string path). The response body is read into `MEM_RESPONSE_BODY` before the file is deleted, so server error bodies survive for diagnostics when `MEM_SAVED=false`. Documented tradeoff: when mktemp falls back to `/dev/null`, the response body is unrecoverable — `MEM_RESPONSE_BODY` stays empty even on server-side failures. The HTTP status code is still captured via `curl -w '%{http_code}'`, so `MEM_SAVED` still works correctly; only the diagnostic body is lost. This is rare (mktemp /tmp failure is a system-level problem) and not worth a more elaborate fallback.

### Changed

- Aligned plugin governance with refactored `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Outcome Verification, Disagreement & Alternatives sections). Items deemed out of scope for a per-run review tool (Session Self-Audit, Active Guardrails, Checkpoint Triggers list, Pre-Claim/Pre-Action Check) were intentionally not imported.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` Governance directives summary to enumerate the two new agent-side directives under the Honesty bullet and to reflect the extended BLIND_HUNTER_NOTE scope.

---

## [1.8.10] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Removed all `--help` / `-h` flag handling from `SKILL.md`. Every implementation approach tried in v1.8.1–v1.8.9 proved unreliable (see note below). `HELP.md` remains as reference documentation accessible in the repo and README.
- Replaced "CodeRabbit-style" wording with neutral language across `SKILL.md`, `HELP.md`, `README.md`, `plugin.json`, and `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## [1.8.9] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Restored eager `!`-prefixed Pre-flight Context injection in `SKILL.md`. These commands run at skill load time before LLM invocation, injecting real repo/branch/diff data into context. The `!` prefix was accidentally removed during the v1.8.x `--help` refactoring, causing the LLM to treat `SKILL.md` as a document to render rather than a workflow to execute.
- Restored imperative opening sentence ("Run a full PR/MR review…") that was lost in the same refactoring.

---

## [1.8.8] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Moved `--help` redirect instruction to the top of the `SKILL.md` H1 heading as a diagnostic test — restored the v1.6.0 instruct-stop pattern verbatim to determine whether failure was body-size dependent. Confirmed: the pattern fails at v1.8.x body size (~1,400 lines); it worked in v1.6.0 at ~200 lines.

---

## [1.8.7] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Introduced a dedicated `comprehensive-review-help` sibling skill using `disable-model-invocation: true` to serve `--help` output without LLM involvement.

### Changed

- Replaced `--help` flag in the main skill with a redirect to `/comprehensive-review-help`.

### Notes

`disable-model-invocation: true` suppressed all output in Claude Code 2.1.152 — the skill ran silently with no output. This approach was abandoned; `comprehensive-review-help` remains as a placeholder stub.

---

## [1.8.6] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Removed duplicate inline flag documentation from `SKILL.md` that gave the LLM fallback content to render when the `--help` injection block was present, causing flags to appear in output alongside or instead of `HELP.md` content.

---

## [1.8.5] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Strengthened `--help` stop instruction to include sentinel markers (`===HELP-START===` / `===HELP-END===`) to give the LLM an unambiguous literal anchor for the help block boundaries.

---

## [1.8.4] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Replaced LLM-executed bash snippet for `--help` with dynamic context injection using the `!`-prefix syntax. The injection command guards on `$ARGUMENTS` so it emits nothing on normal runs. Rationale: injection runs at skill load time before the LLM sees the file, making it deterministic rather than LLM-discretionary.

---

## [1.8.3] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Rewrote `--help` bash snippet as an explicit `Bash` tool call instruction to prevent the LLM from shortcutting to inline flag docs instead of running the command.

---

## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Added Phase 0 step to read and display `HELP.md` when `--help` is present, replacing the previous stub that had no implementation.

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Deferred eager `!`-prefixed pre-flight shell commands (branch detection, diff stats) to after the `--help` check in Phase 0, preventing them from executing and dumping output before help text could be shown.

> **Note on v1.8.1–v1.8.9:** All ten patch releases were attempts to implement a working `--help` flag. Each was tagged and pushed to the marketplace as a candidate, then superseded within the same session when testing revealed it didn't work. The root cause: the LLM receives the entire ~1,400-line `SKILL.md` as context; no stop instruction embedded within it reliably prevents the LLM from processing subsequent content at that body size. v1.8.10 accepts this constraint and removes the flag entirely. See the [v1.8.10 release notes](https://github.com/tag1consulting/claude-comprehensive-review/releases/tag/v1.8.10) for the full account.

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

**Shared governance directives for all custom agents.** A new `skills/comprehensive-review/GOVERNANCE.md` file is loaded once in Phase 0 (step 9) and inlined into every custom agent's task description in Phase 1. Directives cover:

- Harm prioritization (First Law framing)
- No self-preservation (don't suppress findings or hide uncertainty)
- Verification before naming files, functions, flags, packages, versions
- Don't reinvent the wheel (flag reimplementations of stdlib/framework/repo helpers)
- No defensive code for impossible cases
- Non-destructive remediations only (no force-push, `reset --hard`, `DROP TABLE`, etc., as fixes without explicit caveat)
- Named rejected alternatives for non-trivial recommendations
- Surfaced counter-arguments before high-impact recommendations
- Secret redaction at source

All 7 custom agents (`pr-summarizer`, `issue-linker`, `security-reviewer`, `architecture-reviewer`, `adversarial-general`, `edge-case-hunter`, `blind-hunter`) receive the GOVERNANCE block. **blind-hunter exception:** a `BLIND_HUNTER_NOTE` line clarifies that "verify before naming" for blind-hunter applies only within the diff or file list it was given — never the broader repo. This preserves the zero-context constraint while keeping every other directive in force.

**Architecture-reviewer scope-creep lens.** New review section (#8) explicitly hunts for single-use abstractions, hypothetical-future hooks, and reimplementations of existing primitives. Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

**Phase 2 secret-redaction backstop.** New step 2f applies a hardcoded-pattern redaction pass to all finding text and Block A summary text before any external posting. Patterns cover GitHub tokens (`ghp_`/`gho_`/`ghs_`/`ghu_`/`ghr_`), Slack tokens (`xox[baprs]-`), AWS access keys (`AKIA*`), Bearer/Basic auth headers, and assignment patterns for `password=`/`token=`/`api_key=`/`secret=`/`aws_secret_access_key=`. This is defense-in-depth for the agent-source redaction in `GOVERNANCE.md`, not a replacement.

**Orchestrator governance section in SKILL.md.** New section near the top of `SKILL.md` documents the orchestrator-side rules: external comms gated by explicit flags, mandatory user-confirmation prompts before posting, and the new default-branch refuse for `--create-pr`.

**`--create-pr` default-branch hard refuse.** Phase 4 now refuses `--create-pr` when the current branch matches the repository's default branch (queried from the provider via `gh repo view` / `glab api projects/...` / Bitbucket `mainbranch.name`, with `main`/`master`/`develop`/`trunk` as a conservative fallback when the lookup fails). Exits non-zero with a clear error directing the user to check out a feature branch. No override flag.

### Changed

- `security-reviewer.md`, `adversarial-general.md`: brief framing additions noting that the `GOVERNANCE` block is authoritative when present.
- `architecture-reviewer.md`: new "Scope creep and over-engineering" review lens (#8).
- Agent task-description directive table: `GOVERNANCE` added as a new directive consumed by all 7 custom agents.

### Notes

The shared-file approach was chosen over per-agent inlining to make future directive changes single-source. Token cost is ~400 tokens × 7 spawned agents ≈ 2.8k tokens per full review — acceptable given the governance value and the avoidance of drift across 7 separate agent files.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Tab completion doubled name** — restored `name: comprehensive-review` to SKILL.md frontmatter. Without this field Claude Code falls back to the skill directory name, producing `/comprehensive-review:comprehensive-review` in tab completion. The `name:` field was incorrectly removed in v1.6.x under the belief it was unsupported.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

**10 new language profiles** ported from ai-pr-review v0.9.1:
- C# (`csharp.md`) — nullable reference types, LINQ pitfalls, async void, dispose patterns
- JavaScript (`javascript.md`) — prototype pollution, event loop, CommonJS vs ESM
- Kotlin (`kotlin.md`) — null safety, coroutine scope leaks, sealed classes
- Lua (`lua.md`) — 1-based indexing, global-by-default, coroutine edge cases
- Perl (`perl.md`) — context sensitivity, sigil typing, regex gotchas
- Scala (`scala.md`) — implicit resolution, variance, Future execution context
- SQL (`sql.md`) — injection patterns, index usage, NULL semantics
- Swift (`swift.md`) — ARC retain cycles, optional force-unwrap, actor isolation
- Terraform (`terraform.md`) — state drift, resource cycles, provider version pinning
- YAML (`yaml.md`) — Norway problem, implicit type coercions, anchor/alias pitfalls

**Symbol context enrichment** (Phase 0c): on by default for full runs at TIER=small and TIER=medium.
Extracts symbol references from the diff, locates their definitions via `Grep` (ripgrep-backed),
reads ±5 lines of surrounding context, and injects a `<symbol-context>` XML block into eligible
agents. Disable with `--no-enrich-context`. Equivalent to ai-pr-review's Epic 3-A
(treesitter + ripgrep context enrichment) implemented using Claude Code's native tools.

**Per-agent conditional gates** ported from ai-pr-review v0.9.0 `agents/gates.py`:
- `has_control_flow` — skips edge-case-hunter when no branching constructs (if/for/while/match/try) appear in added lines
- `has_code_or_infra` — skips architecture-reviewer on pure docs/meta-only PRs (`.md`, `.rst`, CHANGELOG, README, LICENSE, etc.)
- `has_security_patterns` — extended security keyword and file-path regex to match ai-pr-review's broader pattern set
- `has_error_patterns` — existing silent-failure-hunter trigger now unified with gate framework

**PR narrative context** (Phase 0 step 6): full commit bodies (via `git log --no-merges --format='%H%n%s%n%n%b%n'`)
and PR description body (in `--pr <N>` mode) are now passed to pr-summarizer, code-reviewer,
architecture-reviewer, security-reviewer, adversarial-general, and edge-case-hunter. Reduces
false positives from agents flagging things the author has already explained in commit messages.

**Merge-commit stripping**: commit log now uses `--no-merges` to exclude base-branch merge commits
(e.g., periodic `main → feature` syncs), so agents see only the intentional work.

**Missing ruby-org suppression rule**: added `version-post-knowledge-cutoff-ruby` suppression rule
to `suppressions.json`. The `ruby-org` verify ecosystem was already implemented in SKILL.md Phase 2d
but had no corresponding rule.

**CHANGELOG.md**: this file, backfilled from v1.5.0.

### Changed
- Phase 0 language detection table now explicitly maps all 19 language names to their file
  extensions, ensuring consistent profile loading for the 10 new languages
- agent directive table updated with `PR_NARRATIVE` and `SYMBOL_CONTEXT` directives
- `--no-enrich-context` flag added to HELP.md

### Removed
- **`install.sh`** — removed entirely. The script accumulated five fix commits in v1.6.x trying
  to resolve plugin-cache namespace shadowing between `tag1consulting-local/` (local install) and
  `tag1consulting/` (marketplace install). The root cause was having two install paths at all.
  The marketplace install (`/plugins install comprehensive-review@tag1consulting`) handles
  the same cache path, pr-review-toolkit dependency, and settings registration — with no
  jq/curl prerequisites or shell error-handling complexity. End users and contributors now
  use the same single install path.
- SKILL.md `tag1consulting-local` fallback paths for `language-profiles/`, `suppressions.json`,
  and `scripts/` repointed to `tag1consulting/` (no behavioral change for marketplace installs).

---

## [1.6.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Agent namespace prefix** — all owned agents now use `comprehensive-review:` prefix in `subagent_type` values (e.g., `comprehensive-review:security-reviewer`) to satisfy Claude Code's plugin install path resolution. Fixes #63 where agents dispatched in plugin-install mode were resolving to the wrong (or missing) agent file.
- **SKILL.md fallback paths** — replaced hardcoded `--local` install paths with glob patterns that match any plugin install version, fixing agent resolution for marketplace installs and future version bumps.
- **`install.sh` bootstrap** — `installed_plugins.json` is now auto-initialized with the correct v2 seed format if absent, eliminating the chicken-and-egg failure on first-time installs. (Note: `install.sh` was subsequently removed in v1.7.0; the `/plugins install` path handles this automatically.)

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **checkov IaC security scanner** integration (`scripts/run-checkov.sh`) — scans changed Terraform,
  Kubernetes/Helm YAML, Dockerfiles, CloudFormation, and Azure ARM templates in Phase 1b
- **TruffleHog test-file demotion**: unverified secret detections in test/fixture/example paths are
  demoted to Low/confidence-40 with `[test file — likely mock data]` tag
- **`ruby-org` verify ecosystem** support in SKILL.md Phase 2d (cache.ruby-lang.org HEAD request)
- **Knowledge-cutoff guardrails** added to adversarial-general agent; standardized across all six
  finding-producing agents (architecture-reviewer, security-reviewer, blind-hunter, edge-case-hunter,
  adversarial-general)

### Changed
- ai-pr-review v0.7.0 parity: shared prompt trailer semantics, agent scope refinements

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **adversarial-general agent** — holistic "what's missing" review covering completeness, operational
  readiness, documentation debt, and deployment/rollback concerns. Adapted from BMAD-METHOD (MIT License).
- **Suppression framework** (`suppressions.json`): 6 verify-gated rules (github-release, npm, pypi,
  go-module, cargo, docker-hub) + 2 unconditional rules. Global + per-repo local overrides via
  `.claude/comprehensive-review/suppressions.json`
- **9 language profiles**: Go, Python, TypeScript, PHP (+ Drupal patterns), Ruby, Rust, Java, C++, Shell
- **claude-mem integration** (opt-in with auto-detection): prior review history passed to
  architecture-reviewer and security-reviewer; review summary saved to persistent memory
- **`--depth deep` flag**: promotes blind-hunter and edge-case-hunter to Opus, enables EXTENDED_THINKING
  for architecture-reviewer and security-reviewer, adds CVE reachability triage pass
- **`--no-suppress` and `--min-confidence` flags**
- **TIER=tiny auto-selection** (<50 lines AND ≤3 files): pr-summarizer drops to Haiku; Opus agents
  conditional on infra/security-path triggers
- **TIER=medium context strategy**: custom agents receive file manifest + selective `git diff -- <file>`
  reads; toolkit agents receive diff slices

### Changed
- All agents now use namespace-qualified `subagent_type` values (e.g., `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`)
- Issue-linker returns NONE for non-GitHub providers (avoids false GitHub API calls on GitLab/Bitbucket)
